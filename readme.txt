Falcon Grove Productions, based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, was established in 2014 by David Grover to Produce English language feature films in Europe that will have international appeal.

The Falcon is the fastest moving creature on Earth, capable of diving as speeds of over 300km/hr, and has exceptional powers of vision.  It symbolises the agility and speed necessary to thrive and survive in today's independent film production landscape.

The Grove symbolizes that it's tough to go it alone out there.  Even the falcon recognises that in today's digital landscape, parters are necessary to maximise the revenue generating opportunities across all distribution platforms.

David Grover is the President of Falcon Grove.  He has 15 years experience in financing media and film production companies.  His past clients include Endemol, Talpa, Radio 538, Zodiak Media, Russian World Studios, Electronic Arts, Cineworld, VUE, Omnicom, Eredivisie Media (the Dutch football channel), Sanoma, SBS Broadcasting, Canal Digitaal and Morgan Creek International.

Falcon Grove's current project is the physiological thriller, "Blindfold Vision", currently in pre-production with principal photography scheduled for February 2016.
